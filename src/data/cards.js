    description: `A client website that I built in Gatsby, styled with a combination of Styled Components and React Bootstrap. This was my first paid client site in which I still actively maintain and talk with the owner in terms of revisions and/or updates to the site. I learned a lot building this in terms of optimizing SEO, making sure the site was mobile responsive and optimizing images/videos for a better user experience.`,

    title: 'Portfolio Website Template',
    description: `I built this template for anyone to fork and use for their own portfolios if they liked the design. This was made with Gatsby and styled with Vanilla CSS. This project was primarily for me to practice my skills in Vanilla CSS and ensure that I am capapble of making a website without the use of any CSS Frameworks/Libraries. With a Mobile-First approach, I now have a better understanding of media queries and how to handle certain breakpoints.`,

    title: 'Barbell Weight Calculator',
    description: `A Barbell Weight Calculator that I built in React and styled with TailwindCSS. I wanted to tackle a problem that I have constantly in the gym which is telling how much total weight I have on a barbell. So I wanted to create a calculator that would tell me exactly how many plates I would need in order to reach a certain weight. This app is simple and works both on desktop and mobile. Me and my friends use this all the time with no problems.`,
